# InternationalizationToolkit

Internationalization Toolkit is an Unreal Engine plugin that contains a few simple widgets for testing internationalization and localization settings of a project.

## Description
Widgets provided with this plugin are simple GUI for calling some of the [KismetInternationalizationLibrary](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/Kismet/UKismetInternationalizationLibra-/) functions.

## Installation
To use this plugin you just need to download its files and put inside your Unreal project directory. Note, that you might need to check in Plugins Manager if this plugin is enabled. The `Release` branch is prepared for a clean download of plugin-only files.

## Usage
Just put WBP_CultureSwitcherPanel widget inside of your UIs panels. When in playmode you will be able to switch to any of the found localizaed cultures for game targets.
You can see how it works by analysing a simple test project, that can be found on the `main` branch.
